# a mod that allows you to convert midi input to noteblocks in real-time!
heavily wip

## Current Features:
### /start x y z DIRECTION
currently only places an alternating line of redstone and repeaters at a hardcoded set interval in a single direction, I suppose it could be helpful for redstone

### /stop
stops placing the row of redstone and repeaters

### /place x y z BLOCK
test command, literally just /setblock lol

### /placenoteblock x y z PITCH
also a test command, places a noteblock of a set pitch at a location and also plays the sound it would normally play when activated at the same time!

### /sendmessage
broken test command



also ignore other branches, those are branches with old code ^^
